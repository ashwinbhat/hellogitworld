If I had been a heathen, I'd have praised the purple vine
My slaves would dig the vineyard, and I would drink the wine
But Higgens is a heathen, and his slves grow lean and gray
That he should drink some tepid milk exactly twice a day

If I had been a heathen, I'd have praised Naera's Curls
And filled my life with love affairs, my house with dancing girls
